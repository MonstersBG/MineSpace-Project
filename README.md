# MineSpace-Project

The project in it's purest form can be described as something of a very cheap reddit copy, and by that very cheap
It's main purpose is to have Minecraft players have a community to communicate, in later stages to have item's or topic to talk about, like new updates to the game and so on...


As of contribution to the project a big helper was my best friend and companion, CHATGPT, a true savior.

The project had to be done in a somewhat short amount of time due to time limitations, and a lot of in real life variables that were happening.

It's full potential is still far off due to a lot of things missing.(First part of my journey to making this, at least something)
